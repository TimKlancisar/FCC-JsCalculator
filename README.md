## Tech Used
- React
- Redux
- Sass

## User Stories
- [] User story #1:
    My calculator should contain a clickable element containing an = (equal sign) with a corresponding id="equals".
- [] User story #2:
    My calculator should contain 10 clickable elements containing one number each from 0-9, with the following corresponding IDs: id="zero", id="one", id="two", id="three", id="four", id="five", id="six", id="seven", id="eight", and id="nine".
- [] User story #3:
    My calculator should contain 4 clickable elements each containing one of the 4 primary mathematical operators with the following corresponding IDs: id="add", id="subtract", id="multiply", id="divide".
- [] User story #4: 
    My calculator should contain a clickable element containing a . (decimal point) symbol with a corresponding id="decimal".
- [] User story #5: 
    My calculator should contain a clickable element with an id="clear".
- [] User story #6: 
    My calculator should contain an element to display values with a corresponding id="display".
- [] User story #7: 
    At any time, pressing the clear button clears the input and output values, and returns the calculator to its initialized state; 0 should be shown in the element with the id of display.
- [] User story #8: 
    As I input numbers, I should be able to see my input in the element with the id of display.
- [] User story #9: 
    In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit =, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of display.
- [] User story #10:
    When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.
- [] User story #11:
    When the decimal element is clicked, a . should append to the currently displayed value; two . in one number should not be accepted.
- [] User story #12:
    I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing decimal points.
- [] User story #13:
    If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if 5 + * 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e. 5 * 7); if 5 * - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e. 5 * (-5)).
- [] User story #14:
    Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.
- [] User story #15:
    My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).
